## Administration

  New system user
  CRUD Users
  CRUD Tickets 
  
  I have a note about ticket removal. Probably an admin function for a mistaken ticket entry. 
  NOTE: CRUD is short for Create Read Update Delete not what w think of users or tickets
  
  Notes On Listing Screen
    Listings to filter by status/date/user/tag/type assigned/unassigned open/closed
    
    Some of the data fields we will need are 
    priorty
    status
    notes
    type (cannot read my own notes on this)
    Ticket tag
    dept
    
    Tables
    ticket table
    user table
    equipment
    Installed Software table ( this was added after our meeting with Mr Greenwell)
    
    We will need a separate table for hardware linked to users
    What we are saying is a Greenwell employee uses a computer and we are listing that relationship in data tables.
    
    
    Existing System
    
    There is no existing computer based system. 
    What occurs as I have observed is that Mary down in accounting calls her best frind Sally on the help desk and she gets more memory for her computer while IT has 286's.
