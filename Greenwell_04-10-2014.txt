After a huddle when we ( Mark Patrick & Earle ) talked about the IT Help Desk project we met with Mr Greenwell. He wanted his own screen that shows all the help tickets out. He wanted a filter for open and closed and sorting on key fields. 

We had anticipated this and the screen would be similar to the Admin view only screen.

Then he said (Mr Greenwell) that he wanted to track every computer AND the software on it AND the version of the software on it.
